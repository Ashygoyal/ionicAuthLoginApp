## An Ionic App with User Authentication
With Okta and OpenID Connect (OIDC) you can easily integrate authentication into an Ionic application, and never have to build it yourself again. 
OIDC allows you to authenticate directly against the Okta API, and this article shows you how to do just that in an Ionic application. This app demo shows how to log in with OIDC redirect, using Okta’s Auth SDK as well as how to use OAuth with Cordova’s in-app browser; user registration is omitted as the feature is still under active development.

OpenID Connect (OIDC) builds on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It allows clients to verify the identity of the user and obtain their basic profile information. In this app, we integrate Okta’s Identity Platform for user authentication.
